    "# Logistic Regression with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn Logistic Regression, and then, you'll create a model for a telecommunication company, \n",
    "to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers.\n",

    "# What is the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool \n",
    "for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of \n",
    "guidance on what would be the most probable class for that data point. For this, we use Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recall linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, y, to some predictors (independent variables  𝑥1 ,  𝑥2 , etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "                            y = theta_0 + theta_1*x_1 + theta_2*x_2\n",
    " \n",
    "and finds the values of parameters  theta_0, theta_1, theta_2 , etc, where the term  theta_0  is the \"intercept\". \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be generally shown as:\n",
    "\n",
    "                            h_{theta}(𝑥)=theta^{T}X   (T = transpose)\n",
    "                            \n",
    "Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. \n",
    "It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate \n",
    "into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function 𝜎:\n",
    "    \n",
    "                    ProbabilityOfaClass_1 = P(Y = 1|X) = sigma(theta^{T}X) = (e^{theta^{T}X})/(1 + e^{theta^{T}X)\n",
    "                    \n",
    "In this equation,  𝜃𝑇𝑋  is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), exp is the \n",
    "exponential function and  𝜎(𝜃𝑇𝑋)  is the sigmoid or logistic function, also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" \n",
    "shape (sigmoid curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    [LOOK AT figure1 IN FOLDER]\n",
    "    \n",
    "The objective of Logistic Regression algorithm, is to find the best parameters θ, for  h_𝜃(𝑥)  =  𝜎(𝜃^{T}𝑋) , in such a way \n",
    "that the model best predicts the class of each case.\n",

    "\n",
    "A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. \n",
