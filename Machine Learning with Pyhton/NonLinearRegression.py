# Non Linear Regression Analysis
"""
If the data shows a curvy trend, then linear regression will not produce very accurate results when compared to a non-linear 
regression because, as the name implies, linear regression presumes that the data is linear. Let's learn about non linear 
regressions and apply an example on python. In this notebook, we fit a non-linear model to the datapoints corrensponding to 
China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.

Though Linear regression is very good to solve many problems, it cannot be used for all datasets. First recall how linear 
regression, could model a dataset. It models a linear relation between a dependent variable y and independent variable x. 
It had a simple equation, of degree 1, for example y = 2x + 3.

Non-linear regressions are a relationship between independent variables x and a dependent variable y which result in a 
non-linear function modeled data. Essentially any relationship that is not linear can be termed as non-linear, and is 
usually represented by the polynomial of k degrees (maximum power of x).

                   y = a*x^3 + b*x^2 +c*x +d
 
Non-linear functions can have elements like exponentials, logarithms, fractions, and others. 
For example:

                   y = log(x) 
 
Or even, more complicated such as :
    
                   y = log(a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x +d)
